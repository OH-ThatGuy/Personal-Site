                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>AI tools have become more prominent than ever before. Tasks that previously took
                    a long time can be completed in mere minutes. One particular field that has been
                    heavily affected by AI is that of video editing. Traditionally, editors can
                    spend hours trimming clips, stitching videos together, and adding effects. There
                    is a balance that is needed between technical skill and time management, but AI
                    is shifting that balance. AI video editing is rapidly changing the speed and
                    accessibility of post-production work, but it is simultaneously raising many
                    questions about authorship and authenticity.</p>

            <section class="essay-section" id="what-is-ai-video-editing">
                <h2>What is AI Video Editing?</h2>
                <p>"AI video editing" is a very broad term. In truth, AI can be used at nearly any
                    stage of post-production with varying levels of human input. I believe that AI
                    video editing can be broken down into two categories: AI assisted editing and AI
                    generated content. AI assisted editing is often used as an additional tool that
                    can help expedite the editing process through automation or the removal of
                    otherwise tedious activities. On the other hand, you have AI generated content.
                    This is less of a tool and more of a replacement. Rather than manually edit
                    parts of a video oneself, a user could use Natural Language Processing [NLP] to
                    type a prompt and generate an edited video for them.</p>
                <p>For the most part I will be referring to AI assisted video editing throughout
                    this essay, but knowing what AI generated content is helps to build an
                    understanding of why AI assistance is so helpful and why some frown upon AI
                    generated content.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="technical-side">
                <h2>The Technical Side</h2>
                <p>AI video editing tools rely on a mix of technologies like computer vision,
                    diffusion models, and large language models. As developer Kirk Kaiser describes,
                    these systems don’t simply add AI on top of existing editors, instead they
                    reimagine the editing process itself. Computer vision detects and tracks objects
                    in footage, while diffusion models can insert new, realistic elements.</p>
                <p>Kaiser’s experiments show that traditional video editors weren’t built with
                    generative AI in mind. This led him to create new editing workflows using
                    Microsoft’s Promptflow and later Temporal, which connects AI prompts, code, and
                    rendering into a single automated pipeline. These tools allow a user to enter a
                    prompt and have the system generate scripts, visuals, narration, and subtitles.
                    This essentially turns the editing process into a dynamic collaboration with
                    AI.</p>
                <p>It wasn't all easy though, he was met with various challenges along the way. Some
                    issues included unpredictable prompt design, embeddings often oversimplifying
                    data, and GPU power frequently running low. Building AI tools that are both
                    reliable and creative meant balancing automation with flexibility. Overall, his
                    work highlights that the technical side of AI video editing isn’t just about
                    faster workflows, it’s about changing the way editors interact with the AI
                    itself.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="pros">
                <h2>The Pros</h2>
                <p>If AI is good at one thing, it's automation. AI can take some normally tedious or
                    uninteresting aspects of video editing and have them completed quickly. Some
                    examples of this might be audio balancing or captioning.</p>
                <p>AI can also help to lower the barrier of entry into video editing. Most editing
                    interfaces are complicated and take a while to fully grasp. Using NLP, an AI
                    could help someone new to editing figure out how to perform complex cuts or use
                    effects they would otherwise have ignored.</p>
                <p>AI also helps to speed up the editing process overall. It can allow the editor to
                    spend their time on more complex effects instead of wasting their time with more
                    menial tasks.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="cons">
                <h2>The Cons</h2>
                <p>The biggest issue that many have with AI is the over-reliance on it. It's easy to
                    get comfortable having an AI perform small tasks for you, but that could
                    progress to AI doing more complex actions until the human input is all but
                    nonexistent. This is where AI assisted editing can become AI generated
                    content.</p>
                <p>There is also a fear of homogenization. If every editor made use of the same AI
                    tools to create their content, then all the content would begin to look the
                    same. There is a sort of art or style that each editor has, and AI could take
                    that away if used improperly.</p>
                <p>With AI tools making editing so accessible to everyone, where does that leave
                    entry level editing positions? The demand for entry level editors could rapidly
                    diminish as companies become persuaded to use AI rather than a human component.
                    This issue could potentially even trickle down to higher level positions if the
                    technology advances enough.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="ethical-concerns">
                <h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
                <p>As helpful as AI tools can be, they introduce a number of ethical issues that the
                    industry is still trying to navigate. One of the biggest concerns is
                    attribution. If an AI model pulls from countless sources during training, who
                    gets credit for the final output?</p>
                <p>Transparency is another issue. Viewers may not always know when footage has been
                    altered, generated, or enhanced by AI. This can create problems ranging from
                    slight exaggeration to complete misinformation. As AI editing becomes more
                    seamless, there’s a growing responsibility for editors to disclose when AI is
                    being used and how much of the final video is actually “real.”</p>
                <p>There are also environmental concerns. Training and running generative models
                    requires a massive amount of power. Every seemingly simple automated task relies
                    on high power systems somewhere. As AI becomes more prevalent in editing
                    workflows, the environmental cost of convenience becomes difficult to
                    ignore.</p>
                <p>These concerns don’t mean that AI can’t be used, but they do highlight the need
                    for guidelines. Editors and companies will have to balance efficiency with
                    responsibility, making sure the push for faster workflows doesn’t overshadow
                    questions of ownership, transparency, and sustainability.</p>

            <section class="essay-section" id="future">
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>The video editing workflow as it is known today is likely to experience a shift
                    in the future, not dissimilar to the switch from traditional film editing to
                    computer based editing software. AI tools could become a key component in many
                    interfaces, acting as a sort of "co-pilot."</p>
                <p>Personalized on-demand video generation is also likely to see a spike in
                    popularity. This would likely coincide with new industry standards and
                    legislation to regulate the sea of new content being produced.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>AI video editing has a lot to offer the industry, but it could just as easily end
                    up demolishing it. A balance needs to be struck between efficiency and
                    creativity, with the editor at its center. The future of video editing lies not
                    in replacing editors with AI, but instead in implementing those AI tools into
                    the editing workflow.</p>
