            <section class="essay-section" id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>AI tools have become more prominent than ever before. Tasks that previously took
                    a long time can be completed in mere minutes. One particular field that has been
                    heavily effected by AI is that of video editing. Traditionally, editors can
                    spend hours trimming clips, stiching videos together, and adding effects. There
                    is a balance that is needed between technical skill and time management, but AI
                    is shifting that balance. AI video editing is rapidly changing the speed and
                    accessibility of post-production work, but it is simultaneously raising many
                    questions about authorship and authenticity.</p>

            <section class="essay-section" id="what-is-ai-video-editing">
                <h2>What is AI Video Editing?</h2>
                <p>"AI video editing" is a very broad term. In truth AI can be used at nearly any
                    stage of post-production with varying levels of human input. I believe that AI
                    video editing can be broken down into two categories: AI assisted editing and AI
                    generated content. AI assisted editing is often used as an additional tool that
                    can help expedite the editing process through automation or the removal of
                    otherwise tedious activities. On the other hand you have AI generated content.
                    This is less of a tool and more of a replacement. Rather than manually edit
                    parts of a video oneself, a user could us Natural Language Processing [NLP] to
                    type a prompt and generate an edited video for them.</p>
                <p>For the most part I will be referring to AI assisted video editing throughout
                    this essay, but knowing what AI generated content is helps to build an
                    understanding of why AI assistance is so helpful and why some frown upon AI
                    generated content.</p>

            <section class="essay-section" id="technical-side">
                <h2>The Technical Side</h2>
                <p>I need to do more research on this particular topic, will fill this section
                    later.</p>
                <div class="placeholder">[Image of a Codeblock or Something Similar Here]</div>
            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="pros">
                <h2>The Pros</h2>
                <p>If AI is good at one thing, it's automation. AI can take some normally tedious or
                    uninteresting aspects of video editing and have them completed quickly. Some
                    examples of this might be audio balancing or captioning.</p>
                <p>AI can also help to lower the barrier of entry into video editing. Most editing
                    interfaces are complicated and take a while to fully grasp. Using NLP, an AI
                    could help someone new to editing figure out how to perform complex cuts or use
                    effects they would otherwise have ignored.</p>
                <p>AI also helps to speed up the editing process overall. It can allow the editor to
                    spend their time on more complex effects instead of wasting their time with more
                    menial tasks.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="essay-section" id="cons">
                <h2>The Cons</h2>
                <p>The biggest issue that many have with AI is the over-reliance of it. It's easy to
                    get comfortable having an AI perform small tasks for you, but that could
                    progress to AI doing more complex actions until the human input is all but
                    nonexistent. This is where AI assisted editing can become AI generated
                    content.</p>
                <p>There is also a fear of homogenization. If every editor made use of the same AI
                    tools to create their content, then all the content would begin to look the
                    same. There is a sort of art or style that each editor has, and AI could take
                    that away if used improperly.</p>
                <p>With AI tools making editing so accessible to everyone, where does that leave
                    entry level editing positions? The demand for entry level editors could rapidly
                    diminish as companies become persuaded to use AI rather than a human component,
                    this issue could potentially even trickle down to higher level positions if the
                    technology advances enough.</p>

                <h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
                <p>Potentially roll this section into "The Cons" and rename accordingly. Things to
                    mention include attribution/copyright, transparency, and environmental
                    concerns.</p>

            <section class="essay-section" id="future">
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>The video editing workflow as it is known today is likely to experience a shift
                    in the future, not dissimilar to the switch from traditonal film editing to
                    computer based editing software. AI tools could become a key component in many
                    interfaces, acting as a sort of "co-pilot."</p>
                <p>Personalized on-demand video generation is also likely to see a spike in
                    popularity. This would likely coincide with new industry standards and
                    legislations to regulate the sea of new content being produced.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>AI video editing has a lot to offer the industry, but it could just as easily end
                    up demolishing it. A balance needs to be struck between efficiency and
                    creativity, with the editor at its center. The future of video editing lies not
                    in replacing editors with AI, but instead in implementing those AI tools into
                    the editing workflow.</p>
